I am a Research Faculty in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)-[Maryland Transportation Institute (MTI)](https://mti.umd.edu/), [University of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://umd.edu/). I am honored to work under the supervision of [Dr. Xianfeng (Terry) Yang](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1706/Xianfeng-Terry-Yang) and be part of the [Maryland Transportation & Artificial Intelligence Lab (M-TRAIL)](https://mtrail.umd.edu/). 

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/) in 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Siyang Cao](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/siyang-cao) in the [UA Radar Group](https://github.com/radar-lab). From 2019–2021, I worked at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center, [Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/). I earned my M.E. in Integrated Circuit Engineering from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019 and my B.S. in Applied Physics from [Northeast Petroleum University](https://www.nepu.edu.cn/en/) in 2016. 



My research aims to turn raw sensor data into dependable intelligence for the physical world, with applications in *autonomous driving*, *intelligent transportation systems*, and *smart robotics*. Interests include:


<small>
- 📡 **Sensor Data Processing**  
  *Multi-sensor fusion* and *calibration* across Camera · Radar · LiDAR · GNSS, with attention to *space alignment*, *time synchronization*, *uncertainty modeling*, and *long-term stability*.

- 🎯 **Deep Learning-based Perception**  
  Deep models for *object classification*, *detection*, and *multi-object tracking (MOT)*, with the goal of achieving *real-time, reliability-aware perception* in uncertain and dynamic environments. I also seek to develop *perception-driven prediction, control, and planning* strategies that seamlessly translate perception into action, ultimately supporting proactive, safety-critical decisions at system scale.

- 🔀 **Multimodal Learning**  
  *Vision–Language Models (VLMs)* and *Representation Learning* that integrate information from *multiple sensors and modalities* (e.g., vision, language, and spatial signals) to couple low-level perception with high-level semantics and reasoning for *comprehensive* environment understanding.

> **Research theme.** *From raw, heterogeneous sensors to reliable, quantitatively validated situational awareness for the real world.*
